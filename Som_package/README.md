# Som package for Python
 Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) package for Python

 This python package reproduces the main functionalities of the SOM Matlab Toolbox (chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/http://www.cis.hut.fi/somtoolbox/package/papers/techrep.pdf)

 These functions include creating the data structure for the input data, normalizing the data, training the SOM, demormalizing of the data, finding the best-matching units.
 Further functions, especially for visualization will be added in the future.

 The example dataset is based on the Running and Gait datasets from Fukuji et al.

 A more elaborate description will follow soon...
